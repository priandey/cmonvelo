# WantedVelo API
## First, welcome
WantedVelo API is an online service dedicated to cyclists and institution involved in the fight against bicycle theft.
It allows declaration of a bike theft, with precise description of the bike (reference, picture, traits), consulting 
registered theft and alerting bike owner when his bike is seen (on the market, on the street, etc.).

Visit our browsable service [here](https://www.wantedvelo.eu)

If you wish to integrate our API to your service, see the [public API endpoints](endpoints.md).

Our API is hosted on a small VPS, so if you're planning on having a heavy use of it, consider [reaching out
